Oh, uh, I'm not sure if I can use that for your spaceship. But if you find a few more parts like it, maybe I could make you something else.
I think I'd need, maybe, [color]8805 more parts[color] to build it. You can see how many parts you have by [color]880pressing I to access your inventory.
Well, come on! We don't have all day!

But you're young and spry. You collect, I'll build.
